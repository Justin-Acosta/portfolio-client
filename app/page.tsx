        <p>This website is my personal portfolio, but not only that,
           this is a place where I can record my thoughts and satisfy
           my curiosity. Here, you'll find my organized thoughts About
           software development concepts and practices. The front end 
           is created using Next.js, React, and JavaScript, and the back
           end uses Django and Python.</p>
